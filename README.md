## Projects

### Reactlytics – YouTube Sentiment Analysis Tool (Mar 2025 - Apr 2025)
 _Tech Used: React.js, Flask, TextBlob, YouTube API, Python, Requests_
*   **Problem:** Creators often miss valuable sentiment cues in YouTube comments, hindering their strategies.
*   **Solution:** Integrated the YouTube API with TextBlob and Flask to perform live comment analysis and categorize sentiments.
*   **Impact:** Analyzed over 5,000 comments with 85% accuracy, enabling creators to make data-driven content adjustments.

### DeepReason – Autonomous Multi-Agent Research Engine (FEB 2026 – FEB 2026)
_Tech Used : Python, LangGraph, DeepSeek-R1, Tavily API, Docker._
*   **Problem:** Standard LLMs hallucinate on complex queries and lack the ability to perform deep, verifiable research, often providing shallow or outdated summaries.
*   **Solution:** Architected a cyclic multi-agent system using LangGraph, featuring a "Supervisor" node that autonomously plans research strategies, executes parallel web searches via Tavily, and loops through a "Critic-Reflector" stage to verify facts.
*   **Impact:** Achieved autonomous generation of verified reports with <2% hallucination rate, effectively reducing hours of manual deep research into minutes while maintaining strict data integrity.
